## Introduction 

This is my practice R Markdown file for Bonus Assignment 1.
The goal is to practice using git and GitHub with RStudio.

I am practicing GitHub version control for Bonus Assignment 1.

## Example Summary
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Example Plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist,
xlab = "Speed",
ylab = "Stopping distance",
main = "Cars data example")
```
